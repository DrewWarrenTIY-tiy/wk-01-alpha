    <h1>Different types of Basses</h1>
    <h3>Double Bass</h3>

    <p>
      This is a double bass. It is used predominately in Classical Music, but also can be found in Blue Grass, Jazz and other genres. Sometimes it is referred to as an Upright Bass or a Stand-Up Bass.

    <p>
      There are several variations of the electric bass guitar. The range of sounds that can be produced vary wildly with the musicians style and technique and perhaps also the amp type and settings as well as effects pedals used.

    <h3> 5-String Bass Guitar </h3>

    <p>
      This is a 5-string bass. The '5th' string is added to the lower register. G, D, A, E are the strings on a 4-string bass and the 5th string is the B string.

    <h3>12-String Bass Guitar</h3>
    <img src="images/12-string-bass.jpg" alt="12-String Bass" />
    <p>
      This is a 12-string bass. Some 12-string basses 'clone' each of the four strings twice, adding a reverb effect but not increasing the range of notes available. The one pictured actually adds additional strings on both the higher and lower register to vastly increase the range of pitches that can be produced. It is typically played in a 'tap' style versus the traditional pick or finger-picking style, as seen in the video. Video is actually an 11-string bass and there are many various ranges of strings for extended range bass. I've seen 20 strings before!

    <p>
      These are a Bassoon and a Largemouth Bass. Neither are a Bass.
